Coin Pusher/Crane Game Device SDK
This project contains an SDK for developing applications that can interact and connect with physical coin pusher or crane game arcade machines. It provides functionality for controlling the devices, detecting button presses and coin insertions from players, and monitoring game states in real-time.

The goal of open sourcing this SDK is to allow developers around the world to more easily create new and innovative games for these arcade devices. By standardizing the interface for communication, it lowers the barrier to entry and encourages new applications.

Getting Started
To use this SDK, simply clone this git repository. The code is released under the MIT license so you are free to use, modify and distribute it for any purpose.

Supported Devices
The SDK currently supports connecting to the following coin pusher/crane game devices:
TODO:

It exposes an consistent interface for controlling basic functions like dispensing coins, activating light/sound effects, and returning device states. Support for additional devices can be added upon request.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to the SDK! Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. By working together we can help grow this ecosystem.

We hope this helps provide developers with a simple way to create custom experiences for coin pusher and crane game machines. Have fun and happy coding!
